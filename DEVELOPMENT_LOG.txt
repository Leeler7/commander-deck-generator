COMMANDER DECK GENERATOR - DEVELOPMENT LOG
==========================================
Date: August 15, 2025
Session: Bug Fixes and UI Improvements

INITIAL ISSUES REPORTED BY USER:
1. Deck generation warning about card count seems off - deck is 100 but warning says it's over
2. React "same key" warnings appearing during use
3. Commander should be displayed above all items, not with creatures
4. Remove pricing sources info from Synergy Analysis
5. Clicking Open Moxfield and Open in Archidekt give errors

CHANGES MADE:
=============

1. FIXED DECK COUNT VALIDATION WARNING
   File: src/lib/new-generation-pipeline.ts
   Issue: Validation was running before final deck size adjustment
   Fix: Moved validateDeckComposition call to happen AFTER final deck adjustment
   Lines modified: ~156-199
   Result: Validation now correctly shows 99 cards instead of incorrect higher counts

2. FIXED REACT KEY WARNINGS FOR DUPLICATE KEYS
   Multiple files affected:
   
   a) src/components/ManaCost.tsx (Line 24)
      - Changed from: key={index}
      - Changed to: key={`${symbol.type}-${symbol.value}-${index}`}
   
   b) src/components/Warnings.tsx (Lines 40, 74)
      - Changed from: key={index}
      - Changed to: key={`warning-${index}-${warning.slice(0, 20)}`}
      - Changed to: key={`note-${index}-${note.slice(0, 20)}`}
   
   c) src/components/BudgetPowerControls.tsx (Lines 91, 216)
      - Changed from: key={index}
      - Changed to: key={`char-${index}-${char.slice(0, 15)}`}
      - Changed to: key={`keyword-${keyword}-${index}`}
   
   d) src/lib/new-generation-pipeline.ts (Line 970)
      - Fixed duplicate IDs for basic lands
      - Changed from: id: landName.toLowerCase()
      - Changed to: id: `${landName.toLowerCase()}-${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`
   
   Result: All React key warnings eliminated

3. MOVED COMMANDER DISPLAY TO TOP OF DECK LIST
   File: src/components/DeckList.tsx
   Changes:
   - Separated commander from other cards in filtering logic (Lines 16-24)
   - Added dedicated "Commander" section that always displays at top (Lines 123-137)
   - Modified card filtering to handle commander separately (Lines 141-163)
   Result: Commander now appears in its own section above all other cards

4. REMOVED PRICING SOURCES FROM SYNERGY ANALYSIS
   File: src/components/SynergyAnalysis.tsx
   Changes:
   - Removed pricing sources calculation logic (Lines 38-43)
   - Removed entire "Pricing Sources" display section (Lines 91-106)
   - Replaced "Enhanced Pricing" stat with "Total Cards" (Lines 82-88)
   Result: Pricing sources no longer displayed in Synergy Analysis

5. FIXED MOXFIELD AND ARCHIDEKT EXPORT ERRORS
   Files: src/lib/export.ts and src/components/ExportOptions.tsx
   
   a) src/lib/export.ts
      - Fixed undefined synergy_notes and price_used fields in CSV export (Lines 46, 55)
      - Simplified Archidekt URL generation (removed non-working parameters)
   
   b) src/components/ExportOptions.tsx
      - Updated export buttons to automatically copy deck list to clipboard (Lines 70-96)
      - Improved user experience with alert messages
      - Updated help text to clarify manual pasting requirement
   
   Result: Export functions now work without errors and provide better UX

6. ADDED PROMINENT COMMANDER DISPLAY ON RESULTS PAGE
   File: src/app/page.tsx
   Changes:
   - Added ManaCost component import (Line 21)
   - Added large commander display section between warnings and overview cards (Lines 227-327)
   - Features:
     * Large card image (264px width)
     * Complete card details (name, type, mana cost, colors, stats, price)
     * Oracle text display
     * Responsive layout (side-by-side on large screens, stacked on mobile)
     * Clickable name linking to Scryfall
   
   Result: Commander now prominently displayed with large image and full details
